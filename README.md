**Summary (Abstract / Executive Summary):** A brief description summarizing the project.

**Introduction**
Similar to Candy Crush Saga, coded with Raylib for my university project. The purpose of this project I've undertaken is to successfully emulate Candy Crush Saga with a theme of my own choosing. My expectation is to be able to design the game with a clean code, nice functionalitiy and good looking.

**Methodology**
* **Planned and Structured Development:** Defining needs and creating a foundational structure from the outset prevents disorganized development.
* **Manageability and Ease of Maintenance:** The modular structure makes the code easier to understand, test, and maintain.
* **Scalability:** Adding new features or modifying existing ones is simplified by the modular design, as these operations can be performed with less impact on other parts of the software.
* **Potential for Reusability:** Well-defined functions can potentially be reused in other projects or different sections of the software in the future.

**Results and Evaluation:** An assessment of the project's successes, shortcomings, and future plans.

**Recommendations:** Suggestions, improvements, or forward-looking steps related to the project.
